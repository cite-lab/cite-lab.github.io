# Projects


- **Manuscript networks**.  Traditional stemmatic approaches to reconstruct the transmission of texts assume that manuscripts have a single source.  This assumption is often demonstrably false, and the logic of stemmatic criticism then fails.  This project models networks of interrelated manuscripts to develop a more realistic and nuanced picture of textual transmission.  In this approach, each node in the network is a full diplomatic edition of a manuscript.


- **Ancient Roman tweeting**.  This project studies the state-sponsored messaging disseminated on coins across five centuries of the Roman Empire.  The fundamental data set is derived from the *Online Coins of the Roman Empire* (<http://numismatics.org/ocre/>), "a joint project of the American Numismatic Society and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University."

-  **"Social networks" in *scholia* to the *Iliad*.**  The *scholia* to the *Iliad* illuminate the backstories and  cultural knowledge shared by the audience of the Homeric poems. This project applies social network analysis to collocations of named entities in the *scholia*.  The project uses archival data from the Homer Multitext project (<http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-archive/>), and focuses initially on the uniquely important *scholia* of the Venetus A manuscript, now available for the first time in a complete edition.
